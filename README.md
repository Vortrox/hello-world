First GitHub tutorial repositry

<<(Changes)>>

Hello,

I'm a CS student who likes coding. At the time of writing this, I'm familiar with Python and VB.NET, but I'm looking to try out Java a bit more. I've used some other programming languages in the past for short times including: C++ adapted for Arduino microcontrollers, BASIC adapted for BS2 Parallax microcontrollers, JavaScript, Java.

I like RTS and MMORPG games, and Minecraft.

Hi future me
